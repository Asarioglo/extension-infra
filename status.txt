Trying to separate the docker files and parameterize docker-kong-oidc build so that 
it's a part of the overall build process and not a separate build item which 
needs to run manually. 

At the moment the docker-compose in gateway/kong kinda builds the oidc as well, but 
haven't checked if it actually works.

Seems like on my system the old docker-kong-oidc image is somehow present after
I ran the build.

It is possible that I should investigate a multi-stage Dockerfile instead of splitting
the oidc build into its own directory compltely.

Also, in order to build the service on its own I had to copy the root .env file into that
directory, because the root docker-compose has a dependency and I don't want to build the
entire dependency tree at build stage.
